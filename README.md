# Robot-arm-control-interface
This interface consists of 6 motors, each motor controls a certain angle in the robot arm and was designed so that the user can determine the amount of movement of each angle in the arm, where he chooses the appropriate degree of slider values, and as it appears on the screen, we have two buttons, the first to save the values entered by the user to store them in The database without running the arm. The second takes the slider values and stores them in the database and runs the arm. I used html to build this interface to build the page structure and put sliders and buttons, then I used css to format the page and improve its shape and then moved to the stage of taking values that the user specified from the slider used For this process Java script language, and in the last step, the php language was used to connect the database and send the values entered by the user to the database. When you press the save button, the values are sent to the database, and the value of the arm is 0. When you press the ON button, the values will go to the database and the arm will be turned on so A value of 1 will be sent to the database to run the arm.
